    title: "The New ACFT (2022): Here's What You Need To Know",
    content: [
      "    The Army is introducing a brand new fitness test called the ACFT. This test will replace the current APFT, and it is designed to better assess the physical capabilities of soldiers. The ACFT will include six events: strength deadlift, standing power throw, hand-release pushups, sprint/drag/carry, planks, and 2-mile run. In this blog post, we will discuss all aspects of the new Army fitness test!",
      "The new ACFT is set to finally launch in 2022, and it will be mandatory for all soldiers. The test will be scored on a points system, and soldiers will need to score at least a 60 to pass. The events of the ACFT will measure the following physical abilities: strength, power, endurance, agility, and balance.",

      "The strength deadlift event will require soldiers to lift a weight from the ground to waist height in one smooth motion. The standing power throw event will test the soldier's ability to throw a weighted ball as far as possible. The hand-release pushups event will measure upper body strength and endurance. For the sprint/drag/carry event, soldiers will have to sprint 100 yards, drag a weight sled for 50 yards, and carry weight for 100 yards. The planks event will test the soldier's abdominal strength and endurance. And finally, the two-mile run will measure the soldier's aerobic capacity.",

      "The ACFT is an important step in improving the physical fitness of soldiers. The old APFT was not very effective in assessing all aspects of physical fitness, whereas the new ACFT will do just that. The ACFT is also more challenging than the APFT, so it will better prepare soldiers for combat situations. Overall, the Army ACFT is a much-needed update to the current fitness assessment process!",

    title: "Why Leg Knee Tuck is a better exercise than Plank in the ACFT",
    content: [
      "When it comes to the ACFT, doing planks is one of the worst exercises you can do. Planks are static positions that require you to hold your body in a line from your head to your toes. This is hard enough on its own, but when you add in the fact that you’re performing this exercise before a run, you’re putting yourself at risk for an injury.",

      />,
      "Static exercises such as planks can cause muscles to tighten up, which can lead to injuries like shin splints or even stress fractures. In addition, if you do planks before running, you’re more likely to experience discomfort in your lower back and hips.",
      "Running is a high-impact activity, and when you combine it with a static exercise like planks, you’re asking for trouble. Instead of doing planks in the ACFT, focus on dynamic exercises that will prepare your body for the run.",
      "Finally, doing too many plank repetitions can decrease the strength of your abdominal muscles. A lot of Soldiers preferred the plank over other exercises on the previous ACFT standard because it was easy.  However, the plank is not an easy exercise – it’s one of the hardest. When you do too many repetitions, your abs get used to the position and stop working as hard. This can lead to a decrease in strength and stability when you’re performing more difficult exercises down the road.",
      "Leg knee tucks are a much better option when it comes to strengthening your core. Not only is the leg knee tuck safer and more effective, but it’s also a more dynamic exercise that will help prepare your body for the demands of running. The US Army replacing leg knee tucks for planks in the ACFT is a step in the wrong direction - doing planks in this test is simply badly thought out.",

      "The Army ACFT is Going Back to Gender and Age Standards: Here's Why",
    content: [
      "In a surprising move, the Army has announced that it is going back to gender and age standards for its new physical fitness test, the ACFT. This decision comes as a bit of a surprise, as the Army had initially decided not to go back to these standards. So why has the Army changed its mind?",

      />,
      "There are a few reasons for this change. First, the Army has realized that returning to these standards will help to ensure that all soldiers are physically capable of meeting the demands of their job. Second, the Army believes that returning to these standards will help to reduce injuries among soldiers. Third, the Army feels that returning to these standards is important for morale and cohesion within the force.",
      "While some people may be unhappy with this decision, I believe that it is the right one. The Army has always been a physically demanding organization, and it is important that our soldiers are able to meet those demands. Returning to gender and age standards will help ensure that all soldiers are physically capable of meeting those demands, which in turn will make us a stronger and more effective force. Thanks for reading!",
